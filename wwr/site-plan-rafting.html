        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p> Attrackt new customers
            Make reservations for current customers
            Sell rafting trips
            Make a customer become a recurrent customer</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p> Q: Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation, interests, and so on)
            A: The client is someone either who has already gone rafting and is looking for a new place to practice this activity or someone who is planning a group trip with their friends and/or families. Most of them are people between the ages of 20 and 35 with a stable financial situation because trips in some places can range from $800 to $1400 for 3-4 days. They must like radical sports and may already participate in some water sports.
            Q: What do they want?
            A: They probably want to spend their vacations doing something they like or discovering something new and exciting. They also may want to find a new company to go rafting with, and they are researching companies that have been in business for a long time, comparing pros and cons against other companies.
            Q: What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website?
            A: They most likely expect to find pricing to plan their trips or holidays, they may also want to find contact information to reach the company or a place on the website to arrange or make reservations. Also, they want to find information about the company, such as how many years they've been in business, what activities are available, or in which rivers or places the company has a presence.
