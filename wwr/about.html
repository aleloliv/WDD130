            <p class="p1">Welcome to Raftin Aftin Company, where the thrill of whitewater rafting meets the serenity of nature's beauty.
                Our story began over two decades ago when a group of passionate adventurers came together with a shared love for the great outdoors and a desire to share it with the world. What started as a humble passion project has since evolved into one of the leading rafting companies in the country.                
                From our modest beginnings navigating local rivers, we've expanded our horizons, exploring some of the most breathtaking waterways across the nation. Each river holds its own unique challenges and wonders, and we've made it our mission to uncover them all.</p>
